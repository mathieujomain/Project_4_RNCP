# Events in Paris - RNCP - Mathieu Jomain

The goal of this project was to create a database in MySQL using a dataset of our choice.
For this project I worked on a dataset about events in Paris.

I had to clean the dataset and then create the database with different table containing various informations (location, event type, organisator...).



Import the data to python script for clean, the none necessary columns and rows and nan values, and the years with complete data and the same industries in all tables.

After export of the clean data in to CSV files, imported the files in to a new script of Python, to produce visualizations, to perform a primary data analysis and verify that there were no outlier values, our still missing values and data it no relevance for the study. If necessary, return to the script in python and perform more data clean, to have the files exported in csv, to be imported in to database and future analysis

Create a database, create tables for import of the data information in all the clean files retrieved in csv for all the factors for analysis, and produce some queries that can give some evolution of the economy production.
